<p>*Cause of hypoxemia
- Low FiO2
- Hypoventilation
- V/Q mismatch
- shunt</p>
<p>*The major determinant of normal gas exchange and thus the level of PO2 and PCO2 in blood is the relationship between ventilation (V̇) and perfusion or (Q). This relationship is called the ventilation/perfusion (V̇/Q) ratio.</p>
<p>① The volume of air in the conducting airways is called the anatomical dead space. Dead space ventilation varies inversely with tidal volume. The total volume of gas in each breath that does not participate in gas exchange is called the physiological dead space. It includes the anatomical dead space and the dead space secondary to ventilated but unperfused alveoli.</p>
<p>*Minute (or total) ventilation (V̇E) is the volume of air that enters or leaves the lung per minute: where f is the frequency or number of breaths per minute and VT (also known as TV) is the tidal volume.</p>
<p>*A “dot” above V denotes a volume per unit of time (n): where V̇E is the total volume of gas in liters expelled from the lungs per minute (also called exhaled minute volume), V̇D is the dead space ventilation per minute, and V̇A is alveolar ventilation per minute.</p>
<p>*The ratio of the volume of the conducting airways (dead space) to tidal volume represents the fraction of each breath that is “wasted” in filling the conducting airways.</p>
<p>② The sum of the partial pressures of a gas is equal to the total pressure. The partial pressure of a gas (Pgas) is equal to the fraction of the gas in the gas mixture (Fgas) multiplied by the total pressure (Ptotal). The conducting airways do not participate in gas exchange. Therefore, the partial pressures of O2, N2, and water vapor in humidified air remain unchanged in the airways until the gas reaches the alveolus.</p>
<p>*The first is that when the components are viewed in terms of gas fractions (F), the sum of the individual gas fractions must equal one.</p>
<p>*Thus at sea level, where atmospheric pressure (also known as barometric pressure [Pb]) is 760 mmHg, the partial pressures of the gases in air are as follows.</p>
<p>*The second important principle is that the partial pressure of a gas (Pgas) is equal to the fraction of that gas in the gas mixture (Fgas) multiplied by the atmospheric (barometric) pressure.</p>
<p>*Ambient air is composed of approximately 21% O2 and 79% N2. Therefore, the partial pressure of O2 in inspired ambient air (PO2) is calculated as follows.</p>
<p>*Water vapor exerts a partial pressure and dilutes the total pressure in which the other gases are distributed. Water vapor pressure at body temperature is 47 mm Hg. To calculate the partial pressures of O2 and N2 in a humidified mixture, the water vapor partial pressure must be subtracted from the total barometric pressure. Thus in the conducting airways, which begin in the trachea, the partial pressure of O2 is calculated as follows.</p>
<p><em>Because of changes in the fractions of O2 and CO2, the partial pressures exerted by these gases also change. The partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus (PAO2) is given by the alveolar gas equation, which is also called the ideal alveolar oxygen equation.
</em>실제로 alveolar에서는 pulmonary capillary와 gas exchange가 이루어지고 있고 확산에 의한 동적평형(steady state of O2 consumption)을 이루고 있기 때문에 상기 변수를 고려해줘야 한다. Respiratory Quotient(R) 이란 Steady status라고 가정하고 호흡했을 때 전자전달계를 통해 사용한 O2의 양과 이때 발생하는 CO2의 양의 비라고 생각하면 된다.
*This quotient is the amount of CO2 produced in relation to the amount of O2 consumed by metabolism and is dependent on caloric intake. The respiratory quotient varies between 0.7 and 1.0. Under normal dietary conditions, the respiratory quotient is assumed to be 0.8.</p>
<p>③ The partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus is given by the alveolar air equation (Eq. 23.13). This equation is used to calculate the AaDO2, a useful measurement of abnormal arterial O2.</p>
<p>*Approach to patient with hypoxemia: Harrison’s principles of medicine.</p>
<p>*The fraction of CO2 in the alveolus is a function of the rate of CO2 production by the cells during metabolism and the rate at which the CO2 is eliminated from the alveolus. This process of elimination of CO2 is known as alveolar ventilation. The relationship between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation is defined by the alveolar carbon dioxide equation. V̇CO2 is the rate of CO2 production by the body, V̇A is alveolar ventilation per minute, and FACO2 is the fraction of CO2 in dry alveolar gas. This relationship demonstrates that the rate of elimination of CO2 from the alveolus is related to alveolar ventilation and to the fraction of CO2 in the alveolus.</p>
<p>*Like the partial pressure of any other gas (see Eq. 23.8), PACO2 is defined by the following.</p>
<p>④ The relationship between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation is defined by the alveolar carbon dioxide equation (Eq. 23.14). There is an inverse relationship between the PACO2 and VA, regardless of the exhaled quantity of CO2. In normal lungs, PaCO2 is tightly regulated to remain constant at around 40 mmHg.</p>
<p>*An acute increase in PaCO2 results in respiratory acidosis (pH&lt;7.35), whereas an acute decrease in PaCO2 results in respiratory alkalosis (pH&gt;7.45). Hypercapnia is defined as an elevation in PaCO2, and it occurs when CO2 production exceeds alveolar ventilation (hypoventilation). Conversely, hyperventilation occurs when alveolar ventilation exceeds CO2 production, and it decreases PaCO2 (hypocapnia).</p>
<p>*In the upright position, at most lung volumes, alveoli near the apex of the lung are more expanded than are alveoli at the base. Gravity pulls the lung downward and away from the chest wall. As a result, pleural pressure is lower (i.e., more negative) at the apex than at the base of the lung, and static translung pressure (PL = PA − Ppl) is increased; this results in an increase in alveolar volume at the apex. Because of the difference in alveolar volume at the apex and at the base of the lung (Fig. 23.2), alveoli at the lung base are represented along the steep portion of the pressure-volume curve, and they receive more of the ventilation (i.e., they have greater compliance). In contrast, the alveoli at the apex are represented closer to the top or flat portion of the pressure-volume curve. They have lower compliance and thus receive proportionately less of the tidal volume.</p>
<p>*In addition to gravitational effects on the distribution of ventilation, ventilation in alveoli is not uniform. The reason for this is variable airway resistance (R) or compliance (C), and it is described quantitatively by the time constant (τ).</p>
<p>*Alveolar units with long time constants fill and empty slowly. Thus an alveolar unit with increased airway resistance or increased compliance takes longer to fill and longer to empty. In adults, the normal respiratory rate is approximately 12 breaths per minute, the inspiratory time is approximately 2 seconds, and the expiratory time is approximately 3 seconds. In normal lungs, this time is sufficient to approach volume equilibrium (Fig. 23.3). In the presence of increased resistance or increased compliance, however, volume equilibrium is not reached.</p>
<p>⑤ Because of the effects of gravity, there are regional differences in ventilation and perfusion. The ventilation/perfusion (V̇/Q̇) ratio is defined as the ratio of ventilation to blood flow. In a normal lung, the overall ventilation/perfusion ratio is approximately 0.8. When ventilation exceeds perfusion, the ventilation/perfusion ratio is greater than 1 (V̇/Q̇ &gt; 1), and when perfusion exceeds ventilation, the ventilation/perfusion ratio is less than 1 (V̇/Q̇ &lt; 1). The V̇/Q̇ ratio at the apex of the lung is high (ventilation is increased in relation to very little blood flow), whereas the V̇/Q̇ ratio at the base of the lung is low. In individuals with normal lungs who are breathing room air, the AaDO2 is less than 15 mm Hg; the upper limit of normal is 25 mm Hg.</p>
<p>*Dead space = anatomical dead space + functional dead space
VD/VT = (PaCO2 – PECO2) /PaCO2</p>
<p>⑥ The pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure, low- resistance system. Recruitment of new capillaries and dilation of arterioles without an increase in pressure are unique features of the lung and allow for adjustments during stress, as in the case of exercise. Pulmonary vascular resistance is the change in pressure from the pulmonary artery (PPA) to the left atrium (PLA), divided by cardiac output (QT). This resistance is about 10 times less than in the systemic circulation.</p>
<p>*The pulmonary circulation has two unique features that allow increased blood flow on demand without an increase in pressure: (1) With increased demand, as during exertion or exercise, pulmonary vessels that are normally closed are recruited; and (2) the blood vessels in the pulmonary circulation are highly distensible, and their diameter increases with only a minimal increase in pulmonary arterial pressure.</p>
<p>*Zone 1 represents the lung apex, where Pa is so low that it can be exceeded by PA. The capillaries collapse because of the greater external PA, and blood flow ceases. Under normal conditions, this zone does not exist; however, this state could be reached during positive-pressure mechanical ventilation or if Pa decreases sufficiently (such as might occur with a marked decrease in blood volume). In zone 2, or the upper third of the lung, Pa is greater than PA, which is in turn is greater than Pv. Because PA is greater than Pv, the greater external PA partially collapses the capillaries and causes a “damming” effect. This phenomenon is often referred to as the waterfall effect. In zone 3, Pa is greater than Pv, which is greater than PA, and blood flows in this area in accordance with the pressure gradients. Thus, pulmonary blood flow is greater in the base of the lung because the increased trans-mural pressure distends the vessels and lowers the resistance.</p>

<p><em>Arterial hypoxemia is defined as a PaO2 lower than 80 mm Hg in an adult who is breathing room air at sea level. Hypoxia is defined as insufficient O2 to carry out normal metabolic functions; hypoxia often occurs when the PaO2 is less than 60 mmHg. There are four major categories of hypoxia.
</em>The first, hypoxic hypoxia, is the most common. The six main pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxic hypoxia—anatomical shunt, physiological shunt, decreased FiO2, V̇/Q̇ mismatching, diffusion abnormalities, and hypoventilation—are described in the following sections and in Table 23.2. A second category is anemic hypoxia, which is caused by a decrease in the amount of functioning hemoglobin as a result of too little hemoglobin, abnormal hemoglobin, or interference with the chemical combination of oxygen and hemoglobin. The third category is hypoperfusion hypoxia, which results from low blood flow (e.g., decreased cardiac output) and reduced oxygen delivery to the tissues. Histotoxic hypoxia, the fourth category of hypoxia, occurs when the cellular machinery that uses oxygen to produce energy is poisoned, as in cyanide poisoning. In this situation, arterial and venous PO2 are normal or increased because oxygen is not being utilized.</p>
<p>*In this normal unit, the ventilation/perfusion ratio in each of the alveoli is the same and is equal to 1. The alveoli are perfused by mixed venous blood that is deoxygenated and contains increased PaCO2. PAO2 is higher than mixed venous O2, and this provides a gradient for movement of O2 into blood. In contrast, mixed venous CO2 is greater than PACO2, and this provides a gradient for movement of CO2 into the alveolus. Note that in this ideal model, alveolar-arterial O2 values do not differ.</p>
<p>*The effect of this right-to-left shunt is to mix deoxygenated blood with oxygenated blood, and it results in varying degrees of arterial hypoxemia. An important feature of an anatomical shunt is that if an affected individual is given 100% O2 to breathe, the response is blunted severely. The blood that bypasses the gas-exchanging units is never exposed to the enriched O2, and thus it continues to be deoxygenated.</p>
<p>*The effect of a physiological shunt on oxygenation is similar to the effect of an anatomical shunt; that is, deoxygenated blood bypasses a gas-exchanging unit and admixes with arterial blood. Clinically, atelectasis (which is obstruction to ventilation of a gas-exchanging unit with subsequent loss of volume) is an example of a situation in which the lung region has a V̇/Q̇ of 0. Causes of atelectasis include mucous plugs, airway edema, foreign bodies, and tumors in the airway.</p>
<p>*The alveolar-arterial O2 gradient (AaDO2) is increased because the relative overventilation of one unit does not fully compensate (either by the addition of extra O2 or by the removal of extra CO2) for underventilation of the other unit.
 
⑦ There are four categories of hypoxia (hypoxic hypoxia, anemic hypoxia, diffusion hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia) and six mechanisms of hypoxic hypoxia and hypoxemia: anatomical shunt, physiological shunt, decreased FiO2, V̇/Q̇ mismatching, diffusion abnormalities, and hypoventilation.</p>
<p>⑧ There are two mechanisms of the development of hypercapnia: increase in dead space ventilation and hypoventilation.</p>
<p>*Effect of 100% Oxygen on Arterial Blood Gas Abnormalities
100% O2 through a non-rebreathing face mask for approximately 15 minutes. When the individual breathes 100% O2, all of the N2 in the alveolus is replaced by O2. Thus the PAO2, according to the alveolar air equation (Eq. 23.13), is calculated as follows:</p>
