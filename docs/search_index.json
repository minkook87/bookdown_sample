Thin filaments are composed of actin, tropomyosin, and regulatory proteins (troponin complex, TN) having three subunits: TN-T (binds to tropomyosin), TN-C (binds to calcium ions), and TN-I (inhibitory troponin, which inhibits myosin binding to actin). Calcium binding to TN-C produces a conformation change in the troponin–tropomyosin complex that exposes a myosin-binding site on the actin, leading to ATP hydrolysis.       Summary of Excitation-Contraction Coupling [1] Ca++ enters cell through voltage-gated Ca++ channels during depolarization, which triggers release of Ca++ into the cytoplasm through calcium release channels (ryanodine receptors, RyR) located on the terminal cisternae. [2] Ca++ binds to TN-C, inducing a conformational change in the troponin complex that exposes myosin-binding sites on actin. [3] Myosin heads bind to actin, leading to cross-bridge movement (requires ATP hydrolysis) and reduction in sarcomere length. [4] Ca++ is resequestered by sarcoplasmic reticulum by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA pump) that is inhibited by phospholamban. [5] Ca++ is removed from TN-C, and myosin unbinds from actin (requires ATP); this allows the sarcomere to resume its original, relaxed length. *Abbreviation.

Autonomic nerves and small blood vessels (vasa vasorum in large vessels) are found in the adventitia; vascular smooth muscle is found in the media; and the intima is lined by the endothelium. ⑧ Vascular smooth muscle contains actin and myosin; however, these components are not arranged in the same repetitive pattern as that found in cardiac myocytes. Unlike cardiac muscle contraction, vascular smooth muscle contraction is slow and sustained. ⑨ Increased intracellular calcium, by either increased entry into the cell (through L-type Ca++ channels) or release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, forms a complex with calmodulin, activating myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates myosin light chains (MLC), causing contraction. Dephosphorylation of myosin light chains by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) produces relaxation. *Abbreviation.

Vascular smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is additionally regulated by NO/cGMP-dependent pathways. All these pathways largely affect contraction/relaxation primarily by regulating intracellular calcium and/or by altering protein phosphorylation.

Endothelin-1, which is also synthesized by the endothelium, contracts vascular smooth muscle. 1.2 Electrical activity of the Heart ① The membrane potential is determined primarily by the concentration of sodium, potassium, and calcium ions across the cell membrane, and by the relative conductances of the membrane to these ions. ② The resting membrane potential is very close to the potassium equilibrium potential (calculated from Nernst equation) because the relative conductance of potassium is much higher than the relative conductances of sodium and calcium in the resting cell. Concentrations of K+, Na+, and Ca++ inside and outside a cardiac myocyte at a resting membrane potential of −90 mV. ③ Ions move across the cell membrane through ion-selective channels, which have open (activated) and closed (inactivated) states that are regulated either by membrane voltage or by receptor-coupled mechanisms. ④ Concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium across the cell membrane are maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, the Na+/Ca++ exchanger, and the Ca++-ATPase pump. Phase 0 (depolarization) primarily is due to the rapid increase in sodium conductance (gNa) accompanied by a fall in potassium conductance (gK; K1 channel closing). the initial repolarization of phase 1 is due to opening of transient outward potassium channels (gKto). phase 2 (plateau) primarily is due to an increase in slow inward calcium conductance (gCa) through L-type Ca++ channels. phase 3 (repolarization) results from an increase in gK (Kr and Ks channels) and a decrease in gCa. Phase 4 is a true resting potential that primarily reflects a high gK (K1 channels). ERP, effective refractory period.
